Code for Big Data Analysis project

Mileston 1B 

The R code file is the initial piece of work, this then leads over to the Python file, and then finally back to the R file. 

Note that there are several cells in the Python code that can take several minutes to compile, but rest assured they do work. 

The R code is mainly used for the plots, wheras the Python, (ipynb), code is mainly used for the creation of the actors_score, and twitter_score columns
